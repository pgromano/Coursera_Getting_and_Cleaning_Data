The [original dataset][2] contained accelerometer and gyroscopic data in time (t) and fourier (f) units. The **R** analysis script, `run_analysis.R` will download and tidy this data for simplified use. Training and test data are appended, and only the parameter means and standard deviation are kept, mean() and std() respectively.

The full measures are given below, with XYZ denote the quantity in the X, Y, and Z respectively. All values have a corresponding mean and standard deviation.

* `tBodyAcc-XYZ`
* `tGravityAcc-XYZ`
* `tBodyAccJerk-XYZ`
* `tBodyGyro-XYZ`
* `tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ`
* `tBodyAccMag`
* `tGravityAccMag`
* `tBodyAccJerkMag`
* `tBodyGyroMag`
* `tBodyGyroJerkMag`
* `fBodyAcc-XYZ`
* `fBodyAccJerk-XYZ`
* `fBodyGyro-XYZ`
* `fBodyAccMag`
* `fBodyAccJerkMag`
* `fBodyGyroMag`
* `fBodyGyroJerkMag`

The activity labels are stored as:

* `WALKING`: subject was monitored walking
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was monitored walking upstairs
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was monitored walking downstairs
* `SITTING`: subject was monitored sitting
* `STANDING`: subject was monitored standing
* `LAYING`: subject was monitored laying down
