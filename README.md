# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The following GitHub repository is my submitted Course Project for **Getting and Cleaning Data** within the **John Hopkin's Data Science Specialization**. Included for submission:

* `run_analysis.R`: **R** script file to check for, and if necessary download, the [Smartphone Human Activity Recognition][1] dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository][2]. The data is then processed into *tidy* form.
* `CodeBook.md`: The code book for the *tidy* activity data.
